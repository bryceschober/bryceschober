## Bryce Schober's Profile

- 🛩️ I’m currently working on lots of cool stuff at [Dynon Avionics](https://dynonavionics.com), where our mission is to create the best avionics and aircraft systems for light aircraft.

    We're always interested in hiring passionate engineers that would like to be part of shaping the future in bringing a next-level experience to real-world applications where software meets all kinds of hardware.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been working at Dynon for over 20 years now, how often does that happen as a SW engineer at a small-to-medium-sized company?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning who I really want to be when I grow up. How about you?
- 💬 Ask me about what it's like to be a software engineer and a Jesus follower in this messy world
